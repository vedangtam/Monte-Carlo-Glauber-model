# MC-Glauber-model and MC-Partonic-Glauber-Model

These files contain C++ codes which virtually create collision conditions of High energy Heavy Ion Collisions (Glauber model and Partonic Glauber model) and read the resulting data.

In order to adapt these codes, one needs to make suitable modifications in each of the code.
# Please contact author(or leave comment) if one deals with any kind of difficulty of symantic error in output with the code. Suggestions and contribution is appreciated.
